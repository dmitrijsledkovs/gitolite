<h1>who uses gitolite</h1>

  <blockquote>
  <p>If you're using gitolite and find it very useful in some way, I would
  love to describe your use of it or add a link to your own description
  of it here.  Of course, you can anonymise it as much as you need to.</p>

<p>The <strong>Fedora Project</strong> controls access to over 10,000 package management
repositories accessed by over 1,000 package maintainers <a href="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel-announce/2010-July/000647.html">using
gitolite</a>.  This is probably the largest <em>confirmed</em> gitolite
installation anywhere.  The whole <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/big-config.html">big-config</a> thing was initially done
for them (their config file was so big that without the big-config changes
gitolite would just run out of memory and die!).</p>

<p>The <strong>KDE project</strong> is currently <a href="http://www.omat.nl/2010/07/07/move-to-git-the-progress-so-far/">testing</a> gitolite to see if it will
suit their needs (in combination with redmine for issue tracking and
reviewboard for code review), after an initial <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.kde.scm-interest/1437">review of alternatives</a>
by a core group.  Apart from the usual access control, the KDE folks will be
using many of the "ad hoc repo creation" features enabled by wildrepos and the
accompanying commands.  Some of the changes to the "admin defined commands"
were inspired by KDE's needs.</p>

<p><strong>Prof. Hiren Patel</strong> of the University of Waterloo is responsible for the
existence of the fairly popular "<a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/wildcard-repositories.html">wildrepos</a>" feature.  The
documentation was pretty much written with his use case in mind, but of course
it turns out to be useful for a lot of people.</p>

<p>In fact, he surprised the heck out of me recently by saying that if it hadn't
been for this feature, he might not have used git itself -- which is a pretty
serious compliment if you think about the magnitude of the git project and my
little one-man show!</p>

<p>He explains his use of it <a href="http://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~hdpatel/uwhtml/?p=470">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Gentoo Linux</strong> has <a href="http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_2812c9b9e768f64b46360ab17b9d0024.xml">just moved</a> their git repositories from gitosis
to gitolite. There are about 200 repositories, some of them are the so called
<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/">overlays</a>, official and unofficial/user overlays, plus several
developer and project repositories, used by more than 1000 people. That number
will be increased in the near future, as they are going to migrate some of
their CVS/SVN repositories there, plus they are offering overlays hosting for
users as well.</p>

<p><strong>Nokia MeeGo</strong> uses Gitolite internally, and has also contributed LDAP
specific code (see <a href="http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/contrib/ldap">contrib/ldap</a> directory for details).</p>
